Application lets users view current world news, search for topics of interests, and store desired searches and news articles.


## Check deployed website!
It may take 1-2 minutes for website to 'run' if the website has been unactive for a long time.\
Also same for MongoDB database cluster. If website unactive, database unactive, cluster down :(
